Additional Comments: 

- The UI picture above is merely just that - A picture, Better interactivity will be shown in the final version - for e.g Highlighted over hover, filled out colours when on page

- Set creation goes on in the middle, I'm not yet sure in how I want to pursue the UI design for this
- The left hand side is reserved for all the stats of the items your character has including characteristic points
- Right side is for the information, i.e the private link you send to people to view your items and the exo's
